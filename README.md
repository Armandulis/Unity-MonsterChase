# Unity-MonsterChase
My first simple 2d game made with Unity by following [bootcamp tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB1F9G0JXOo).

It's a simple game where you run and try to dodge enemies, if enemies touches you, you lose. You can see your score at the top right.  2 scienes, one is a game menu, another is game play.
